# nurhussen portfolio

This code is an HTML document that defines the structure and content of a personal portfolio website.


--This is the start of the HTML document. The <!doctype html> declaration indicates that this is an HTML5 document. The <html> element wraps around the entire document and specifies the language as English. The <head> element contains metadata for the document such as the character encoding and viewport settings. The <title> element specifies the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab.


--This section contains the main content of the webpage. The <div> element with class "hero" wraps around the entire content and serves as the container for the hero section of the webpage. Inside the hero section, we have a <nav> element that contains the website logo and a list of links to other sections of the webpage. The links use the href attribute to specify the location of the target section using the id attribute of the corresponding <div> element. The first section is wrapped in a <div> element with id="detail" which contains a heading and some introductory text. The next <div> element contains an image.
